# advent_of_code

This repository contains my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, written in different. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and challenge types. 🎅🏻

## Used Programming Language

- 2023: `C++`

## Structure of the Repository

Each day's challenge is stored in a separate directory named `day_xx` where `xx` is the day number. Inside each directory, you will find:

- one or multiple input files
- 2 source files: `main1.cpp` and `main2.cpp` which contain the solutions for the first and second part of the challenge respectively
- (optional) a inputReader parser file in the root directory of a year (e.g. `inputReader.cpp` in `2023`)
