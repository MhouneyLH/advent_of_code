# Year 2023

This year I decided to use `C++` as my main programming language to solve the challenges.

## Running the code

1. Navigate to the directory of the day you want to run

   ```bash
   cd ./day_01
   ```

2. Compile the code

   ```bash
   g++ main1.cpp -o main1.o -Wall
   ```

3. Run the code

   ```bash
   ./main1.o
   ```

4. Have fun! 🎅🏻
